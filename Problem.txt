Three input files use this code, but the first output file is currently finished other two showing garbage. 

 
I am trying to sort three files (I/O) using bubble sort. For this purpose, I write this code.


First input file function output is working properly. Second and third input function gives garbage value in output file two and three. 


But I can't seem to locate any solutions to a similar problem. I'm really having trouble with understanding file I/O for some reason. Thanks in advance for the help.
